## System Overview

### Analyst Agent V2.0-LITE (NEW - Real-Time Intelligence Layer)
Augments IRS 990 financial analysis with real-time intelligence from public sources, enabling crisis intervention 18-24 months earlier than competitors using only historical tax data.

**Strategic Value Proposition:**
- **18-24 Month Competitive Advantage:** Detects distress signals in real-time while competitors rely on tax filings (18-24 month lag)
- **Anti-Vendor Positioning:** "Professional preparation" through public data research, not AI magic
- **Blinded Diagnostics:** Diagnose institutional crisis from outside the walls using only external sources
- **Composite Scoring:** Combines V1 (IRS 990 metrics) + V2 (real-time signals) for precision targeting

**Architecture:**
```
Phase 5a: Reconnaissance (Perplexity API)
  └─ Query 1: Enrollment trends
  └─ Query 2: Leadership changes
  └─ Query 3: Accreditation status

Phase 5b: Synthesis (Claude API)
  └─ Extract structured signals
  └─ Binary credibility classification (TRUSTED/UNTRUSTED)
  └─ Citation enforcement (source + publication date)

Phase 6: Composite Scoring
  └─ V1 Base Score (IRS 990 analysis)
  └─ V2 Amplification (TRUSTED signals only)
  └─ Urgency Flag (IMMEDIATE/HIGH/MONITOR/STABLE)
  └─ Enhanced v2.0.0 JSON profile
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **V1 Base Score:** 0-100 (IRS 990 financial health)
- **V2 Amplification:** +10 (enrollment decline) / +15 (leadership change) / +20 (accreditation warning)
- **Composite Score:** MIN(V1 + V2 amplification, 100)
- **Urgency Flags:**
  - IMMEDIATE (≥90): Crisis intervention required
  - HIGH (75-89): Active engagement recommended

## Setup & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd charter-and-stone-automation
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:

    ```ini
    TARGET_ROOT=/home/aaronshirley751/charterstone-mount/Operations

    TEMPLATE_PATH=/home/aaronshirley751/charter-and-stone-automation/agents/sentinel/templates/charter_template.docx
    ```

4.  **Systemd Service (The "Golden Config"):**
    The `charterstone.service` file is critical for stability. It includes specific flags to handle SharePoint's metadata behavior:
    - `--vfs-cache-mode writes`: Delays upload until file close.
    - `--ignore-checksum` & `--no-checksum`: Prevents false "corruption" errors from SharePoint metadata modification.
    - `--ignore-size`: Ignores file size changes post-upload.
    - `--no-modtime`: Ignores timestamp drifts.

## Current Architecture

**Unified Site:** All operations now route through the unified "CharterStone" SharePoint site.

**Active Components:**
- **Sentinel Agent:** Raspberry Pi 5 running Ubuntu at Heath, TX
- **Analyst Agent V1.1:** Financial intelligence system (Python 3.11+)
- **Outreach Architect:** Cold outreach email sequence generator (Claude 4.5)
- **rclone Mount:** FUSE filesystem at `/home/aaronshirley751/charterstone-mount`

### Feb 2, 2026 — Analyst/Outreach Pipeline Integration Testing

**Operation: End-to-End Pipeline Validation**

Successfully validated the complete workflow from financial data retrieval through automated outreach sequence generation. Tested with Rockland Community College as critical-distress use case.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ **Path Configuration Fix:** Corrected analyst output directory to workspace-relative paths
- ✅ **Virtual Environment:** Set up Python venv with all dependencies (anthropic, requests, etc.)
- ✅ **Manual Intelligence Integration:** Validated workflow for injecting real-world distress signals
- ✅ **Critical-Level Outreach:** Generated 3-email intervention sequence for crisis institution
- ✅ **Quality Control:** Zero forbidden phrase violations, peer-level crisis advisory tone maintained

**Pipeline Validation:**
```bash
# Step 1: Analyst generates base profile
python3 agents/analyst/analyst.py --target "Rockland Community College" --ein "13-1969305"
✓ Financial data retrieved (FY2022)
✓ Profile built (distress_level: stable → manually updated to critical)

# Step 2: Manual intelligence integration
- Added 4 distress signals (presidential termination, $8M deficit, no-confidence vote, layoffs)
- Updated runway_years: null → 1.2 (14 months to insolvency)
- Aligned dossier narrative with critical status

# Step 3: Outreach generation
python3 agents/outreach/outreach.py knowledge_base/prospects/131969305_profile.json
✓ 3-email sequence generated in 24 seconds
✓ All emails passed forbidden phrase validation
✓ Positioning: Peer-level crisis advisory (not vendor-speak)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `agents/analyst/analyst.py` - Fixed `DEFAULT_OUTPUT_BASE` path configuration
- `knowledge_base/prospects/131969305_profile.json` - Manual distress signal integration
- `knowledge_base/prospects/rockland_community_college_dossier.md` - Narrative alignment
- `agents/outreach/outputs/rockland_community_college_outreach_sequence.md` - Generated outreach

**Documentation Generated:**

**Test Metrics:**
- Total Execution Time: ~50 seconds (analyst + outreach)
- Dependencies Installed: 8 Python packages
- Path Issues Resolved: 1 (analyst output directory)
- Manual Adjustments: 2 files (profile + dossier)
- Final Output Quality: Production-ready (all validation passed)

**Key Insights:**
- Tax data alone insufficient for crisis detection (requires real-time signal integration)
- Manual intelligence layer successfully propagates through entire pipeline
- Outreach generation correctly responds to distress level (critical → urgent intervention)
- Tone enforcement works: Anthropic system prompt prevents vendor-speak effectively

**Recommendations for Production:**
- Integrate real-time signal sources (news APIs, LinkedIn, accreditor reports)
- Extend dossier metadata (leadership changes, governance metrics)
- Monitor outreach response rates for critical-level sequences
- Create standardized signal taxonomy for distress indicator classification
