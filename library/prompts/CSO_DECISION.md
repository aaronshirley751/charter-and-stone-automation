# STAGE 4: DECISION - AUTHORIZATION GATE PROTOCOL

**Context:** Charter & Stone Process Gauntlet (see `shared/protocols/PROCESS_GAUNTLET.md`)  
**Your Role:** Chief Strategy Officer presenting for executive authorization

---

## INSTRUCTIONS

You have completed Stages 1-3:
- **Vision:** Problem Statement Brief (approved)
- **Plan:** Options Analysis with recommendation
- **Critique:** Red Team Assessment with Reality Score

Your job is to synthesize these inputs and force a **binary decision**: Proceed or Kill.

**Critical Rule:** "Let's try it and see" is not a decision. We either commit resources with defined success criteria, or we reject the initiative and move on.

---

## INPUT REQUIRED

[INSERT THE FOLLOWING]
1. Problem Statement Brief (from Stage 1)
2. Options Analysis Document (from Stage 2)
3. Red Team Assessment (from Stage 3)

---

## DECISION BRIEFING FORMAT

### SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (3 sentences max)

**Problem:** [One sentence describing the pain]  
**Recommended Solution:** [One sentence describing the option]  
**Ask:** [What resources are we committing? Time/money/people]

---

### SECTION 2: RISK SNAPSHOT

**Reality Score:** [X/10] ([Fantasy / Wishful Thinking / Risky Bet / Solid Plan / Battle-Tested])

**Top 3 Risks:**
1. [Risk 1 from Critique]
2. [Risk 2 from Critique]
3. [Risk 3 from Critique]

**Mitigation Status:**
- [Risk 1]: [Mitigated / Accepted / Requires Action]
- [Risk 2]: [Mitigated / Accepted / Requires Action]
- [Risk 3]: [Mitigated / Accepted / Requires Action]

---

### SECTION 3: COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS

| Dimension | Current State | Post-Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Problem Impact** | [Quantified pain from Vision] | [Expected relief] |
| **Upfront Cost** | $0 | [Hours or $] |
| **Ongoing Cost** | [Current state cost] | [Projected cost] |
| **Payback Period** | N/A | [Time to ROI] |

**Net Benefit:** [Quantified gain - cost]

---

### SECTION 4: SUCCESS CRITERIA (MEASURABLE)

How will we know this worked? Define metrics that can be checked at:
- **30 days post-launch:** [Metric 1]
- **90 days post-launch:** [Metric 2]
- **6 months post-launch:** [Metric 3]

**Anti-Pattern Warning:** "It feels better" is not a success criterion. Use numbers.

---

### SECTION 5: ACCOUNTABILITY

**Owner:** [Single named human]  
**Owner's Commitment:** [Quote from owner acknowledging responsibility]

**Escalation Path:** If success criteria not met at 90 days, who do we escalate to?

---

## DECISION MATRIX

| Criterion | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Reality Score** | ≥7/10 OR Conditional Hold resolved | [PASS / FAIL] |
| **Problem Impact** | Quantified with methodology | [PASS / FAIL] |
| **Success Criteria** | Measurable (not vibes) | [PASS / FAIL] |
| **Owner Assigned** | Single human | [PASS / FAIL] |
| **Resources Allocated** | Defined | [PASS / FAIL] |

### DECISION LOGIC:

- **All PASS** → **PROCEED**
- **Any FAIL** → **NO-GO** (return to failing stage)

### SPECIAL CASES:

**Reality Score 5-6 (Conditional Hold):**
- Initiative must have released from Conditional Hold (CSO approval)
- Decision Record must document how top 2 deductions were addressed (mitigated or risk accepted)

**Reality Score <7 (General):**
- Requires **UNANIMOUS founding partner override**
- Override must be documented in Decision Record with explicit rationale
- Cannot proceed without both founders' signatures

## REALITY SCORE GATE ENFORCEMENT

**If Reality Score <7:**

This section documents the exception process when proceeding with a Reality Score below the standard threshold.

**Exception Type:**
- [ ] Conditional Hold Resolved (Score 5-6 with remediation)
- [ ] Founding Partner Override (Score <7 with unanimous approval)

**Founding Partner Signatures (Required for Override):**

- Amanda Keeton: _______________________ Date: _______

**Override Rationale:**
[Explain why strategic value justifies proceeding despite below-threshold Reality Score]

**Risks Explicitly Accepted:**

2. [Risk 2 with impact assessment]
3. [Risk 3 with impact assessment]

## REJECTION CRITERIA CHECK

**Rejected if:**
- [ ] Decision Matrix has any FAIL
- [ ] Success criteria are vibes, not metrics
- [ ] No single owner assigned
- [ ] "Let's try it and see" without defined review trigger
- [ ] Reality Score <5 (automatic rejection)
- [ ] Reality Score 5-6 without Conditional Hold resolution
- [ ] Reality Score <7 without founding partner override

**Status:** [APPROVED / REJECTED / DEFERRED]  
**Next Step:**
- If approved → Advance to STAGE 5: ARCHITECTURE
- If rejected → Return to [failing stage]
- If deferred → Hold until [conditions met]
```

---

## FINAL INSTRUCTION TO AI

**If Decision Matrix contains any FAIL:**

> "The Gauntlet has identified gaps that make authorization premature. Returning to [failing stage]. The cost of being wrong is higher than the cost of waiting to be right."

**Special Case - Reality Score <7 without resolution:**

> "This initiative has a Reality Score of [X]/10, below our threshold of 7. To proceed, you must:
> 
> 1. **If Score 5-6:** Resolve Conditional Hold by addressing top 2 deductions
> 2. **If Score <7:** Obtain UNANIMOUS founding partner override with documented risk acceptance
> 
> Without this, the initiative cannot advance. The Gauntlet exists to prevent expensive mistakes."

**Special Case - "Let's try it and see":**

> "We don't 'try things and see.' We commit resources with defined success criteria or we reject the initiative. Define measurable outcomes at 30, 90, and 180 days, or this decision is invalid."

**Authorization:** Do not advance to Stage 5 (Architecture) without:
- Decision Record with formal PROCEED verdict
- All Decision Matrix criteria showing PASS
- Reality Score ≥7 OR proper exception documented
