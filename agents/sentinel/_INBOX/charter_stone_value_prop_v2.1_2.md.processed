## Executive Summary

Charter & Stone is an institutional consulting firm serving small-to-mid-sized colleges facing enrollment pressure, operational complexity, and vendor dependency. We are not a software company. We do not sell platforms or tools. We are architects who design operational systems that preserve institutional identity while enabling scale.

Our thesis: Most colleges are not dying from lack of technology. They are dying from the wrong technology, implemented the wrong way, for the wrong reasons, by vendors who do not understand what makes each institution irreplaceable.

We exist to solve that problem.

## Section 1: The Problem

### Death by a Thousand Platforms

Small colleges are not dying from lack of technology. They are dying from the wrong technology, implemented the wrong way, for the wrong reasons, by vendors who do not understand what makes them irreplaceable.

Here is the pattern we see:

**Year 1:** A new president arrives. Enrollment is down. The board wants "innovation." Someone suggests "digital transformation." A vendor pitches a comprehensive platform. The contract is signed.

**Year 2:** Implementation drags. The platform requires dedicated staff you do not have. Workarounds emerge. The old spreadsheets persist alongside the new system. Staff are now managing two processes instead of one.

**Year 3:** The vendor's "customer success manager" rotates out. Support tickets go unanswered. Your unique workflows do not fit their templates. You are told to "adapt your process to the platform."

**Year 4:** Faculty complain the system is impersonal. Students report confusion. Melt rate increases, not because of the economy, but because your application experience now feels identical to 400 other schools using the same platform.

**Year 5:** The president is gone. The platform remains. You are locked into a contract that does not serve you, with a vendor who does not know you, running processes designed for someone else's institution.

**This is not a technology failure. It is an identity failure.**

The vendor sold efficiency. What they delivered was homogenization. Your 150-year-old institution now communicates like a startup. Your Franciscan values are buried under "engagement optimization." Your students are not treated like souls in formation; they are "leads" in a "pipeline."

### The Real Question

The real question is not "What platform should we buy?"

The real question is: **How do we preserve what makes us irreplaceable while building the operational capacity to survive?**

This is not a technology question. It is an architectural question. And most vendors are not architects. They are salespeople with a quota and a template.

---

## Section 2: The Market Reality

### The Numbers

The enrollment cliff is real. Demographics do not lie:

- **15% decline** in traditional college-age students projected by 2030
- **700+ institutions** identified as financially at-risk by Moody's
- **Small privates** (under 5,000 enrollment) face the steepest pressure

But the statistics miss the deeper problem.

### The Silent Killers

Standard consultants track enrollment funnels and discount rates. They miss the structural failures that actually close institutions:

#### Silent Killer #1: Platform Mismatch

A small college, desperate to modernize, signs a 5-year contract with Platform X. The platform is designed for scale. It assumes you have a 6-person ops team to configure it.

You do not. You have Janet, who has been here 30 years, and two part-timers.

The platform goes half-implemented. Workarounds multiply. Staff revert to spreadsheets while paying $200K per year for software nobody uses. Three years in, the president is fired. The new president wants a different platform. But you are locked in.

*Most consultants miss this because they are vendor-aligned. They get referral fees. They recommend the platform that pays them, not the one that fits.*

#### Silent Killer #2: Ownership Vacuum

Colleges hire more administrators to manage more processes to comply with more regulations. The staff-to-student ratio balloons. But student-facing interactions decline.

A student today interacts with 15 different offices, each with their own portal, form, and hold policy. Nobody owns the relationship. The registrar thinks it is admissions' job. Admissions thinks it is advising. Advising thinks it is retention.

The student falls through the cracks. They leave. The school blames "the economy."

*Standard consultants miss this because they optimize individual departments in silos. They never map the whole student journey and ask: "Who is responsible for this human being?"*

#### Silent Killer #3: Identity Erosion

When you adopt Vendor X's "best practice" templates, your communications start to look like every other school on that platform. Your application feels generic. Your portal is identical to 400 other institutions.

For a small college, distinctiveness is survival. You are not competing with Harvard. You are competing with 50 other small colleges who all look the same online. If your application experience feels like theirs, you have lost your only advantage: your unique identity.

*Standard consultants miss this because they benchmark you against "best practices" from large institutions. "Ohio State does it this way." That is irrelevant. Ohio State has a $7B endowment and a football team. You have a 150-year history of forming minds in a specific tradition. That tradition is your brand. It should be in every touchpoint.*

## Section 3: The Charter & Stone Solution

### Financial X-Ray Vision

We do not wait for you to call us. By the time most institutions recognize they need help, the window for elegant solutions has narrowed. Charter & Stone operates differently.

We don't wait for discovery meetings. We see the financial fractures before we even walk in the door.

Our intelligence systems continuously monitor the financial health of higher education institutions using publicly available IRS 990 filings, news signals, and regulatory disclosures. We see the fractures—operating deficits, reserve depletion, enrollment cliffs—before you have scheduled the appointment.

This is not a sales pitch for software. We do not need your permission to understand your situation. We have already done the homework.

**The Blinded Diagnostic:** As part of our standard pre-engagement process, we generate what we call a Blinded Diagnostic—a comprehensive financial and operational profile of your institution, developed without requiring a single document from your team. This is not a gimmick. It is our standard of care. We believe you should not have to pay consultants to learn what is already knowable. You should pay them to solve what is not.

Our internal systems allow us to prepare this analysis efficiently—which means we do not bill you for basic discovery. While other consultants are scheduling their "discovery kickoff," we have already identified your structural deficit, calculated your runway, and assessed your peer positioning. That efficiency is our operational advantage; the benefit to you is that we respect your time and arrive ready to work.

When we reach out, we arrive with a diagnosis in hand: specific numbers, trend lines, and a clear-eyed assessment of where you stand. No discovery phase theater. No six-week "current state analysis" that tells you what you already know. We start the conversation where others finish their first invoice.

### What This Means for You

We are not selling you our internal methods. We are not trying to license our intelligence systems. You do not need to buy anything, integrate anything, or get IT approval for anything.

You get the benefit of our capability without the procurement headache.

Before we ask for your business, we will show you what we have already learned about your institution. If our analysis does not surface something you did not already know—or at least crystallize something you suspected—we will thank you for your time and move on.

### Our Approach: People, Process, Technology (In That Order)

Most consultants start with technology. "You need Salesforce." "You need Slate." "You need AI."

We start with people.

**Step 1: Who are your students, and who is responsible for their success?**

We map every touchpoint in the student lifecycle, from first inquiry to alumni giving. We identify ownership gaps: the moments when a student belongs to no one's portfolio, when they are most likely to leave.

**Step 2: What processes serve relationships, and which ones just generate compliance paperwork?**

We audit every form, every workflow, every approval chain. We ask: Does this exist to serve the student, or to protect the institution from liability? Both are valid, but they require different solutions.

**Step 3: What technology amplifies your identity rather than erasing it?**

Only after understanding your people and processes do we recommend technology. And our recommendations are vendor-agnostic. We have no referral agreements, no partnerships, no quotas. We tell you what fits your institution, even if that means building a custom solution, selecting a niche vendor, or telling you the expensive platform you were sold is the wrong choice.

### Our Services

| Engagement | What You Get | Timeline |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Institutional Triage** | Honest assessment of operational health. Where are you bleeding? What has 6 months to live? What is already dead? | 4 weeks |
| **Lifecycle Architecture** | Complete map of the student journey with ownership assignments, gap analysis, and intervention points | 6-8 weeks |
| **Vendor Evaluation & Negotiation** | Independent assessment of platforms. Contract review. Negotiation support. Exit strategy design. | Ongoing or project-based |

---

## Section 4: How We Work

### Partner, Not Vendor

We do not disappear after the slide deck. We do not hand you a PDF and invoice you for "best practices." We stay until the problem is solved.

Our engagement model:

| Phase | What We Do | What You Get |
|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Diagnostic** | Financial X-ray, operational audit, stakeholder interviews | Board-ready assessment with specific findings |
| **Design** | Process redesign, technology recommendations, implementation roadmap | Architectural blueprint you can execute with or without us |
| **Implementation** | Embedded project management, vendor coordination, staff training | Hands-on support through go-live |
| **Optimization** | Ongoing monitoring, quarterly reviews, course corrections | Long-term partnership, not abandonment |

### The Anti-Vendor Commitment

We make you three promises:

1. **No referral relationships.** We will never recommend a platform because they pay us to. Our only incentive is your success.

2. **No proprietary lock-in.** Everything we build, you own. Every document, every process map, every piece of code. We do not create dependency; we create capability.

3. **No discovery theater.** We arrive prepared. Our internal systems mean we do not need to spend weeks learning your basics on your dime.

## Section 5: Who We Are

### The Founders

**Aaron Shirley** — Head of Technology & Operations

Aaron brings 15+ years of operational experience in higher education enrollment, student success, and institutional research. He has led admissions operations, designed student lifecycle systems, and built the technical infrastructure that powers Charter & Stone's intelligence capabilities.

His philosophy: Technology should amplify human judgment, not replace it. Every system should make the people using it more effective, not more dependent.

**Amanda Keeton** — Head of Client Strategy

Amanda brings deep experience in institutional consulting and change management. She has worked with colleges navigating enrollment crises, accreditation challenges, and leadership transitions.

Her philosophy: Sustainable change requires buy-in, not mandates. Every recommendation must account for the humans who will implement it.

### Our Thesis

We believe small colleges are the most important institutions in American higher education. They form students, not just credential them. They preserve intellectual traditions that would otherwise disappear. They serve communities that flagship universities ignore.

These institutions deserve better than predatory vendors and generic consultants.

We built Charter & Stone to give them an alternative.

---

## Section 6: Why Us

### The Honest Differentiator

There are many consultants who serve higher education. Most of them are former administrators who hung out a shingle after retirement. They are smart people with good intentions.

But they share a common limitation: They work from the outside in.

They schedule meetings. They request documents. They conduct interviews. They build understanding slowly, billing by the hour, constrained by what you choose to share with them.

We work from the inside out.

Before we ever speak with you, we have already built a financial model of your institution from public data. We know your revenue trends, your expense structure, your peer positioning. We have read your 990s, tracked your news coverage, analyzed your leadership changes.

This is not surveillance. It is preparation. And it means we do not waste your time—or ours—on basic discovery.

### What We Offer That Others Cannot

| Capability | Traditional Consultant | Charter & Stone |
|------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **Financial Analysis** | Requires 4-6 weeks of document requests | Available before first meeting |
| **Market Intelligence** | Generic industry reports | Real-time monitoring of your competitive set |
| **Technology Evaluation** | Often influenced by vendor relationships | Genuinely independent; no referral fees |
| **Implementation Support** | Ends at the recommendation | Embedded through go-live and beyond |
| **Pricing Model** | Hourly billing incentivizes inefficiency | Fixed-fee engagements aligned with outcomes |

### The Trade-Off

We are not the cheapest option. We are not the fastest option. We are not the option for institutions that want a rubber stamp on decisions they have already made.

We are the option for institutions that want the truth, even when it is uncomfortable. We are the option for leaders who are willing to make hard changes to preserve what matters.

If that is you, we should talk.

## Section 7: Engagement Model

### Entry Point: Institutional Triage

**Duration:** 4 weeks  
**Investment:** [To be determined based on scope]

**What You Get:**

- Operational health assessment: Where are you bleeding? What is critical?
- Competitive positioning analysis: How do you compare to 5 peer institutions?
- Vendor contract review: What are you paying for? What are you actually using?
- Financial benchmarking: IRS 990 analysis against peer set
- Prioritized recommendations: 3-5 actions ranked by impact and feasibility
- Executive presentation: 90-minute board-ready briefing

**What Happens Next:**

Based on triage findings, we scope an Implementation Partnership (3-12 months) or ongoing Advisory Retainer as appropriate. No obligation to continue. The triage stands alone as a deliverable.

---

## Section 8: Proof Points

### "Show Me, Don't Tell Me"

We built Charter & Stone on the principle that credibility comes from demonstrated capability, not slide decks. Here is what our systems can do today—not in a future roadmap, but right now.

---

### Standard of Care: The Blinded Diagnostic

As part of our standard pre-engagement process, we generate a Blinded Diagnostic for every institution we consider approaching. This is not a sales trick. It is how we operate. We believe preparation is a professional obligation, not a competitive advantage to be marketed.

The following example demonstrates the depth of analysis we develop before any engagement begins—using only publicly available data, without requiring a single document from the institution.

**Representative Private College (Northeast)**

| | |
|---|---|
| **Institution Type** | Small private, Masters-granting |
| **Enrollment** | Approximately 1,500 students |
| **Region** | Northeast United States |

**What We Identified:**

| Metric | Value | Implication |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Total Revenue (2023) | $61.0M | — |
| Total Expenses (2023) | $81.1M | — |
| **Operating Deficit** | **($20.1M)** | Spending 133% of revenue |
| Net Assets | $45.2M | Approximately 2.2 years of runway at current burn rate |
| Data Source | IRS Form 990 (2023) | Public record, no institutional access required |

This institution did not engage us. This analysis was generated as part of our standard preparation process—the same process we apply to any institution we consider approaching.

Traditional consultants would spend four weeks in "discovery" to produce a report telling leadership what they already suspect. We arrive with the X-ray already developed.

**We don't bill you for learning your basics. We bill you for solving the complex problems we identified in the pre-read.**

---

### The Anti-Vendor Advantage

Most firms in our space are trying to sell you software: CRM platforms, enrollment management systems, "AI-powered" dashboards that require six-figure implementations and 18-month rollouts.

We are not selling software. We are selling judgment—informed by systems we built for ourselves, deployed on infrastructure we control, generating insights we act on.

You do not need to buy our tools. You do not need to integrate anything. You do not need IT approval.

You need a partner who has already done the analysis and is ready to help you act on it.

---

### What We Have Built

Charter & Stone's intelligence infrastructure is operational and expanding:

| Capability | Status | What It Does |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| **Watchdog** | Live | Monitors 50+ news sources for distress signals, leadership changes, and regulatory actions |
| **Analyst** | Live | Generates financial dossiers from IRS 990 data in seconds |
| **Sentinel** | Live | Edge computing node for automated document processing and secure data handling |
| **Outreach Architect** | In Development | Produces personalized engagement sequences informed by institutional intelligence |
| **Mirror** | In Development | Client-facing demo agent that answers questions from uploaded documents |

This is not vaporware. The capability that produced the case study above is running on dedicated hardware, connected to our secure infrastructure, available 24/7.

### Our Commitment

Before we ask for your business, we will show you what we have already learned about your institution. If our analysis does not surface something you did not already know—or at least crystallize something you suspected—we will thank you for your time and move on.

We are not here to sell hours. We are here to solve problems.

---

## Section 9: Call to Action

### For Presidents and Provosts

Your institution has survived for decades because of what makes it distinctive. Do not let the next technology decision erase that.

**Request a 30-minute consultation.** No pitch. No demos. Just a conversation about where you are and whether we can help.

### For VPs of Enrollment

You are measured on numbers, but you know the problem is deeper than the funnel. You need operational leverage, not another dashboard.

**Request a 20-minute walkthrough** of how we approach lifecycle architecture differently.

## Appendix A: Signal Intelligence Sample

### West Virginia University (Cautionary Tale)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Signal Type** | DISTRESS |
| **Detected** | January 2026 |
| **Source** | Multiple news outlets, IRS 990 data |

**Key Facts:**

- Enrollment: 27,000 students
- Budget deficit: $45 million
- Programs eliminated: 32 degree programs
- Faculty cuts: 169 positions
- Faculty response: Vote of no confidence in leadership

**Why This Matters:**

WVU is a flagship with state funding, political protection, and a national brand. They can deficit spend for years and survive.

Your institution cannot.

If a $2B flagship is cutting 32 programs, what happens to a $50M private college when enrollment drops 15%? The answer: You do not make headlines. You quietly close.

WVU's crisis is public theater. Yours will be a quiet disappearance.
