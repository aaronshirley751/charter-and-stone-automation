## Email 1: Cold Intro
**Subject:** Re: Your $8M structural deficit disclosure  
**Timing:** Day 0

The news about your president's termination and the hidden $8M deficit is public now. That's a brutal combination for any CFO to inherit.

We ran a financial diagnostic on Rockland Community College. Your expense ratio shows you're actually operating below break-even at 0.804—unusual for an institution with an $8M structural deficit. That suggests either aggressive cost-cutting already happened or the real picture is more complex than reported.

With 66.7% tuition dependency and 1.2 years of runway, you're facing decisions that will define whether Rockland exists in 2026.

Would a 20-minute conversation about what we found be useful? This isn't a vendor call—we don't sell software. We advise institutions navigating financial crises.

## Email 2: Value Add
**Subject:** Re: Rockland's 1.2-year operations runway  
**Timing:** Day 5-7 (if no response)

Following up on my previous note about your financial position.

Two findings from our analysis:

1. At current burn rate, you have approximately 1.2 years of net assets remaining. That's assuming enrollment holds steady—which rarely happens after presidential terminations make headlines.

2. Your 66.7% tuition dependency means a 10% enrollment drop translates to roughly $2.4M in lost revenue. The Faculty Senate's 43-0 no-confidence vote won't help recruitment.

WVU just cut 32 programs and 143 faculty positions—and they have state funding plus R1 status. Rockland has neither.

This is not a pitch meeting. It's a diagnostic conversation about whether your institution can survive the next 18 months.

Are you the right person to discuss this with, or should I connect with your interim president?

## Email 3: Break-up
**Subject:** Closing the loop  
**Timing:** Day 10-14 (if no response)

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume this isn't the right time for a conversation.

If your situation changes—board intervention, accreditor concerns, or when that 1.2-year runway shrinks—reach out anytime.

## Analyst Notes
Critical-level outreach for Rockland CC. The presidential termination with security escort and hidden $8M deficit are nuclear-level events that create immediate urgency. The 0.804 expense ratio is puzzling given the reported deficit—suggests either recent cuts or accounting irregularities. With only 1.2 years runway and 66.7% tuition dependency, they're in existential territory. Email sequence emphasizes peer-level crisis advisory positioning, uses their specific numbers to demonstrate expertise without insulting their intelligence, and maintains dignity despite the urgent situation.
