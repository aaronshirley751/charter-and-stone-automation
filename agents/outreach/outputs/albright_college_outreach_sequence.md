## Email 1: Cold Intro
**Subject:** Re: Your CFO transition and 12% enrollment decline  
**Timing:** Day 0

Ms. Schulman,

Stepping into the CFO role at Albright during a 12% enrollment decline is a tough hand to be dealt. Budget cuts before you arrived suggest the board knows the math isn't working.

We ran a financial diagnostic on Albright's operating model. The findings are sobering but actionable.

Would a 20-minute conversation about what we found be useful?

## Email 2: Value Add
**Subject:** Re: Albright's 3.2-year runway  
**Timing:** Day 5-7 (if no response)

Ms. Schulman,

Two findings from our Albright analysis:

1. Your expense ratio is running at 1.08x revenue. At that burn rate, you have roughly 3.2 years of reserves remaining.

2. With 68% of revenue from tuition, a 15% enrollment drop would push your deficit to 1.12x—accelerating reserve depletion to under 24 months.

These aren't vendor talking points. This is what we tell boards when they hire us to prevent closure.

This would be a diagnostic conversation, not a sales pitch. We don't sell software. We help CFOs restructure operations before the math becomes terminal.

Would 20 minutes next week work?

Best,

## Email 3: Break-up
**Subject:** Closing the loop  
**Timing:** Day 10-14 (if no response)

Ms. Schulman,

I haven't heard back, so I'll assume this isn't the right time.

If your situation changes—board pressure intensifies, accreditation review comes up, enrollment projections worsen—reach out anytime.

Best,

## Analyst Notes
Sequence targets new CFO Jennifer Schulman who inherited a deficit operation with declining enrollment. Email 1 acknowledges her difficult position without condescension. Email 2 delivers hard numbers (3.2-year runway, 68% tuition dependency) to create urgency without catastrophizing. Email 3 maintains dignity with clean exit. Tone avoids vendor-speak while establishing peer-level crisis advisor positioning.
