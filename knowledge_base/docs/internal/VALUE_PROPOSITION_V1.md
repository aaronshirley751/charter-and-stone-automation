# Executive Summary

Charter & Stone is an institutional consulting firm serving small-to-mid-sized colleges facing enrollment pressure, operational complexity, and vendor dependency. We are not a software company. We do not sell platforms or tools. We are architects who design operational systems that preserve institutional identity while enabling scale.

Our thesis: Most colleges are not dying from lack of technology. They are dying from the wrong technology, implemented the wrong way, for the wrong reasons, by vendors who do not understand what makes each institution irreplaceable.

We exist to solve that problem.

# Section 1: The Problem

## Death by a Thousand Platforms

Small colleges are not dying from lack of technology. They are dying from the *wrong* technology, implemented the wrong way, for the wrong reasons, by vendors who do not understand what makes them irreplaceable.

Here is the pattern we see:

**Year 1:** A new president arrives. Enrollment is down. The board wants "innovation." Someone suggests "digital transformation." A vendor pitches a comprehensive platform. The contract is signed.

**Year 2:** Implementation drags. The platform requires dedicated staff you do not have. Workarounds emerge. The old spreadsheets persist alongside the new system. Staff are now managing two processes instead of one.

**Year 3:** The vendor's "customer success manager" rotates out. Support tickets go unanswered. Your unique workflows do not fit their templates. You are told to "adapt your process to the platform."

**Year 4:** Faculty complain the system is impersonal. Students report confusion. Melt rate increases, not because of the economy, but because your application experience now feels identical to 400 other schools using the same platform.

**Year 5:** The president is gone. The platform remains. You are locked into a contract that does not serve you, with a vendor who does not know you, running processes designed for someone else's institution.

**This is not a technology failure. It is an identity failure.**

The vendor sold efficiency. What they delivered was homogenization. Your 150-year-old institution now communicates like a startup. Your Franciscan values are buried under "engagement optimization." Your students are not treated like souls in formation; they are "leads" in a "pipeline."

## The Real Question

The real question is not "What platform should we buy?"

The real question is:

> *How do we scale human connection without losing what makes us worth connecting to?*

This is not a technology question. It is an architectural question. And most vendors are not architects. They are salespeople with a quota and a template.

# Section 2: The Market Reality

## The Numbers

The enrollment cliff is real. Demographics do not lie:

- **15% decline** in traditional college-age students projected by 2030
- **700+ institutions** identified as financially at-risk by Moody's
- **Small privates** (under 5,000 enrollment) face the steepest pressure

But the statistics miss the deeper problem.

## The Silent Killers

Standard consultants track enrollment funnels and discount rates. They miss the structural failures that actually close institutions:

### Silent Killer #1: The Vendor Lock-In Death Spiral

A small college, desperate to modernize, signs a 5-year contract with Platform X. The platform is designed for scale. It assumes you have a 6-person ops team to configure it.

You do not. You have Janet, who has been here 30 years, and two part-timers.

The platform goes half-implemented. Workarounds multiply. Staff revert to spreadsheets while paying $200K per year for software nobody uses. Three years in, the president is fired. The new president wants a different platform. But you are locked in.

Most consultants miss this because they are vendor-aligned. They get referral fees. They recommend the platform that pays them, not the one that fits.

### Silent Killer #2: Administrative Bloat vs. Student Touchpoints

Colleges hire more administrators to manage more processes to comply with more regulations. The staff-to-student ratio balloons. But student-facing interactions decline.

A student today interacts with 15 different offices, each with their own portal, form, and hold policy. Nobody owns the relationship. The registrar thinks it is admissions' job. Admissions thinks it is advising. Advising thinks it is retention.

The student falls through the cracks. They leave. The school blames "the economy."

Standard consultants miss this because they optimize individual departments in silos. They never map the whole student journey and ask: "Who is responsible for this human being?"

### Silent Killer #3: Brand Dilution Through Platform Homogenization

When you adopt Vendor X's "best practice" templates, your communications start to look like every other school on that platform. Your application feels generic. Your portal is identical to 400 other institutions.

For a small college, distinctiveness is survival. You are not competing with Harvard. You are competing with 50 other small colleges who all look the same online. If your application experience feels like theirs, you have lost your only advantage: your unique identity.

Standard consultants miss this because they benchmark you against "best practices" from large institutions. "Ohio State does it this way." That is irrelevant. Ohio State has a $7B endowment and a football team. You have a 150-year history of forming minds in a specific tradition. That tradition is your brand. It should be in every touchpoint.

# Section 3: The Charter & Stone Solution

## What We Do

We do not sell software. We do not install platforms. We do not have a "product" you subscribe to.

We are **institutional architects**. We design the operational blueprint that lets your staff stop pushing paper and start building relationships, without sacrificing what makes your institution distinctive.

## Our Approach: People, Process, Technology (In That Order)

Most consultants start with technology. "You need Salesforce." "You need Slate." "You need AI."

We start with people.

**Step 1: Who are your students, and who is responsible for their success?**

We map every touchpoint in the student lifecycle, from first inquiry to alumni giving. We identify ownership gaps: the moments when a student belongs to no one's portfolio, when they are most likely to leave.

**Step 2: What processes serve relationships, and which ones just generate compliance paperwork?**

We audit every form, every workflow, every approval chain. We ask: Does this exist to serve the student, or to protect the institution from liability? Both are valid, but they require different solutions.

**Step 3: What technology amplifies your identity rather than erasing it?**

Only after understanding your people and processes do we recommend technology. And our recommendations are vendor-agnostic. We have no referral agreements, no partnerships, no quotas. We tell you what fits your institution, even if that means building a custom solution, selecting a niche vendor, or telling you the expensive platform you were sold is the wrong choice.

## Our Services

| Engagement | What You Get | Timeline |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Institutional Triage** | Honest assessment of operational health. Where are you bleeding? What has 6 months to live? What is already dead? | 4 weeks |
| **Lifecycle Architecture** | Complete map of the student journey with ownership assignments, gap analysis, and intervention points | 6-8 weeks |
| **Vendor Evaluation & Negotiation** | Independent assessment of platforms. Contract review. Negotiation support. Exit strategy design. | Ongoing or project-based |
| **Implementation Partnership** | We stay through execution. Not a report that sits on a shelf, but active partnership until the system works. | 3-12 months |
| **Executive Bridge** | Interim leadership support during transitions. Continuity when the president leaves and the board panics. | As needed |

## The Outcome: From Process Managers to Relationship Builders

The goal is not "automation." Automation without design just makes bad processes faster.

The goal is **operational liberation**: freeing your staff from data entry, form chasing, and system navigation so they can do what they were hired to do. Know students by name. Intervene before the crisis. Represent your mission in every conversation.

When we are done:

- Your admissions counselors spend 70% of their time talking to students, not updating records
- Your financial aid team awards aid in days, not weeks, with packages that reflect institutional priorities
- Your advisors see the full student picture without logging into 6 systems
- Your communications sound like your institution, not a template

This is not about buying AI. It is about engineering human connection at scale.

# Section 4: Ideal Client Profile

## Who We Serve Best

| Attribute | Target Range | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Enrollment** | 1,000 to 15,000 (sweet spot: 2,500 to 8,000) | Large enough to have complexity, small enough to lack dedicated ops staff |
| **Institution Type** | Private nonprofit, regional public | Faith-based, liberal arts, regional comprehensives |
| **Financial State** | Operating deficit OR declining net assets | Not yet in crisis, but trend line is concerning |
| **Decision Velocity** | President + Cabinet can move in weeks, not semesters | Bureaucratic flagships are not our market |

## Who We Do Not Serve

- **Flagship state universities** (WVU, Ohio State, etc.): Their problems are political, not operational. We use their failures as cautionary tales.
- **For-profit institutions**: Different economics, different mission, different constraints.
- **Institutions in active closure**: We are turnaround architects, not hospice care.

## Primary Buyer Personas

| Role | Why They Care | What They Fear |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **VP of Enrollment** | Owns the funnel. Measured on numbers. Needs operational leverage. | Another consultant who delivers a report and disappears. |
| **CFO** | Sees the cash burn. Needs ROI clarity. Skeptical of "transformation" promises. | Signing a 5-year contract that becomes shelfware. |
| **President/Provost** | Owns the mission. Needs to preserve identity while modernizing. | Losing what makes the institution distinctive. |

# Section 5: Why Charter & Stone

## The Anti-Vendor

Let us be direct about what we are not:

**We are not a software company.** We do not have a platform to sell you. We do not get paid more if you buy Salesforce vs. Slate vs. a custom build. Our incentive is to find the right answer, not the profitable answer.

**We are not a body shop.** We do not staff your project with junior analysts fresh from MBA programs who learn your industry on your dime. Our team has operated inside enrollment offices, financial aid departments, and president's cabinets. We know what the vendor promised. We know what actually happened.

**We are not neutral observers.** We sit on your side of the table. When a vendor makes a claim, we pressure-test it. When a contract has a trap, we find it. When an implementation is going sideways, we tell you, even if that is uncomfortable.

## The Vendor Problem

Most technology vendors serving higher education have a structural conflict of interest:

They make money when you buy their platform. They make more money when you expand your contract. They lose money when you leave.

This means:

- They will always recommend more technology, not less
- They will scope implementations to require ongoing support (which they sell)
- They will resist customization that makes you less dependent on them
- They will benchmark you against other clients to normalize their templates

**We have no such conflict.** Our engagement ends when your system works. We are not trying to create a dependency. We are trying to make you operationally sovereign, able to run your institution without calling us.

## What We Bring

| Capability | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **Vendor Agnosticism** | We recommend what fits, not what pays us |
| **Operational Experience** | We have sat in the seats your staff sit in |
| **Implementation Persistence** | We do not hand off a report and disappear |
| **Speed Without Shortcuts** | Our internal methods let us work faster, but the work is still rigorous |
| **Identity Preservation** | We design for your mission, not a generic template |

## The Question to Ask Any Consultant

Before you hire any consultant, ask them:

> *"What do you sell besides your time?"*

If the answer involves a platform, a partnership, or a "preferred vendor," understand that their recommendation is compromised. They may still be good. But they are not neutral.

We sell time, expertise, and outcomes. That is it.

# Section 9: Call to Action

## For Presidents and Provosts

Your institution has survived for decades because of what makes it distinctive. Do not let the next technology decision erase that.

**Request a 30-minute consultation.** No pitch. No demos. Just a conversation about where you are and whether we can help.

## For VPs of Enrollment

You are measured on numbers, but you know the problem is deeper than the funnel. You need operational leverage, not another dashboard.

**Request a 20-minute walkthrough** of how we approach lifecycle architecture differently.

# Appendix A: Signal Intelligence Sample

## West Virginia University (Cautionary Tale)

**Signal Type:** DISTRESS  
**Detected:** January 2026  
**Source:** Multiple news outlets, IRS 990 data

**Key Facts:**

- Enrollment: 27,000 students
- Budget deficit: $45 million
- Programs eliminated: 32 degree programs
- Faculty cuts: 169 positions
- Faculty response: Vote of no confidence in leadership

**Why This Matters:**

WVU is a flagship with state funding, political protection, and a national brand. They can deficit spend for years and survive.

Your institution cannot.

If a $2B flagship is cutting 32 programs, what happens to a $50M private college when enrollment drops 15%? The answer: You do not make headlines. You quietly close.

WVU's crisis is public theater. Yours will be a quiet disappearance.
